# pix2pix-facade-UNet_G-PathGAN_D-Transfer
A simple reproduction of the paper "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" (using facade data set, extracting the data compression package before running)

# datasets
The "facade" dataset is reproduced this time. Create a "datasets" directory under the project folder and a "facade" folder below it. Under the "facade" folder, there should be folders "train" and "test" to store the corresponding data sources.
